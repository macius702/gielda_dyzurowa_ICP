3. **Build and run the Docker image**

    Use the following command to build the Docker image and run it in interactive mode:

    ```bash
    ./build_and_run.sh
    ```
    You can then go to another terminal and run tests with:
    ```
    ./test.sh from_backend.json
    ```
    This command will run the tests using the data from `from_backend.json`.

4. **Or build, run and test in one go**

    ```
    ./build_and_run.sh test
    ```
    This command will build the Docker image, run it in detached mode, and then run the tests.

## Useful commands

For Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
command="curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{ \\\"hello\\\": \\\"world\\\" }\" \"http://$(dfx canister id d_backend).localhost:$(dfx info webserver-port)\"" ; echo $command
```

After running this command in the Docker terminal, you can copy the output and paste it into the host's terminal to execute it.
